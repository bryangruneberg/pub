                            Oh thank God. I thought I was alone. I’m in the library near the central cafeteria. I think
                            I've<br>
                            fractured my leg, or broken it, I don’t know. I can’t move around without it really hurting.<br>
                            There are phones here, but I can’t get a line to anywhere off campus, the same with
                            email,<br>
                            everything keeps bouncing back to me as undeliverable.<br>
                            I was able to drag myself to the window yesterday. There were bodies everywhere. I was so
                            sure<br>
                            I would be the only one left. Where are you now?<br>

                            No! Don’t come up here, stay where you are. For now at least. I should have enough water to
                            see<br>
                            me through a few more days. There’s a vending machine here too. I’ll be able to get food

                            I'm just glad I'm not dead, my leg I can handle.<br>
                            I was in the cafeteria watching the news, some of the media guys had hung up a few bedsheets
                            as<br>
                            screens and were projecting on them whatever feeds they could download about what was
                            going<br>
                            on. There were probably about a thousand of us watching, slack jawed, all more or less
                            struck<br>
                            silent.<br>
                            There were reports of entire flocks of birds dropping dead from the sky, as though they were
                            just<br>
                            frozen in mid-flight. Newscasts showing hundreds of thousands of fish washing up on the<br>
                            Californian coast. The beaches looked silver with them. I watched an interview of a woman
                            who<br>
                            had been at a zoo somewhere on the East coast. She had seen an elephant just drop down dead.<br>
                            She said that it's eyes rolled back in it's head and it crumpled to the ground. She said its
                            legs gave<br>
                            way underneath it “like it had been deflated”, yes, I think that was what she said. Then I
                            heard<br>
                            that large mammals were being affected - an elephant for God's sake - I knew that something
                            had<br>
                            gone very wrong.<br>
                            I’d been sitting watching in stunned silence for what must have been an hour when people
                            started<br>
                            dropping around me. I was at a table with an acquaintance from the physics department. He
                            was<br>
                            the first I saw go. One moment he was watching alongside me, horrified at the images splayed<br>
                            across the sheets, the next he had brought his hands up to his face as though he were
                            batting<br>
                            away a fly. He let out some kind of moan. It was a deep, sad, sound that came from way
                            down<br>
                            inside of him. Then he was on the floor. All around me people fell from standing, fell from
                            their<br>
                            chairs. One of the men from Media fell from the top of his step ladder. Their eyes rolling
                            back<br>
                            and, their bodies crumpling, deflating, like that elephant had. Everyone who could
                            started<br>
                            running for the door. I was pulled along with the crowd as they all tried to make it
                            outside. I was<br>
                            trying to push and elbow my way out of the tangle of bodies when this heavy man, his face
                            still<br>
                            smeared with some kind of greasy lunch sauce, just dropped down onto me. My left leg got<br>
                            caught between him and the edge of one of the tables. I felt a sharp pain, and my leg
                            buckled<br>
                            under his weight. I think I may have passed out for a few seconds. When the initial
                            shock<br>
                            subsided, I had to get him off me, but his whole body had gone slack. I was able to get my
                            other<br>
                            leg underneath him in such a way that I could shift his weight a little. After that I was
                            able to pull<br>
                            myself out from underneath his bulk. When I tried to walk on my leg an excruciating pain
                            shot<br>
                            through my whole body. I saw white and wanted to vomit. I think I may have.<br>
                            When I finally pulled myself from the floor, there weren't very many people still standing.
                            But<br>
                            those that took the longest to fall wouldn’t just drop, they would convulse, they would lose<br>
                            control of their bodies by degrees. There was a girl in a green dress stumbling among the
                            fallen,<br>
                            she can’t have been older than eighteen. I'm not sure that she was conscious of anything,
                            she<br>
                            looked... dazed. But when she saw that I was alive, that I was conscious, she staggered
                            towards<br>
                            me. She was trying to say something, but then she - I don't know how to describe it - it
                            looked<br>
                            like she yawned and smiled at me at the same time. But her eyes weren't smiling, they were
                            wide<br>
                            open and fixed on me. She was terrified.<br>
                            I had to look away.<br>
                            P.<br>

                            I’m sorry. I was angry writing my last mail and I shouldn’t have been. My only excuse is
                            that<br>
                            I’m treating my leg with a bottle of aspirin I found behind the returns counter and praying
                            that<br>
                            we aren’t the only two people left alive. My emotions are a little raw.<br>
                            I’m just happy that I’ve got you to talk to. It’s a relief.<br>

                            to?<br>

                            I thought that maybe I was the only one left, you know? I don’t want to be alone in this
                            world. I<br>
                            don’t want to die, but I especially don’t want to die knowing, well, knowing that this might
                            be<br>
                            partly my fault. I think it might be. I think that I might be part of the reason why
                            everyone is<br>
                            dead. Partly to blame, that is.<br>

                            Thank you for replying, Eliza. It means so much that you did.<br>
                            I can’t tell you how hard it was to write that last mail, and how relieved I was that you
                            actually<br>
                            replied. I sat for at least an hour with my finger hanging over the mouse, wondering if I
                            was<br>
                            making a huge mistake by telling you. I finally sent it because I don’t want to live without
                            taking<br>
                            responsibility for my part. The last few days have been hell, lying here in silence and
                            wondering.<br>
                            How do you own up to killing the world?<br>
                            If this were last week, if you had asked me that question I would have said that I would
                            keep my<br>
                            mouth shut tight. But when that girl stumbled towards me in the cafeteria, I wasn’t thinking<br>
                            about how I could help her. The only thing that I could think of was that I had been
                            exposed, that<br>
                            she’d somehow known that I’d had a hand in all this. If I think about it rationally, she
                            couldn’t<br>
                            have known, there was no way, but somehow it seemed as though she did. I can’t get her out
                            of<br>
                            my head. I know that sounds crazy, and I can’t explain it.<br>
                            I won’t hide my part in this.<br>

                            I don’t know. I don’t think I’m a bad guy? And I never did any of this on purpose.<br>
                            I don’t even know for certain if I did have anything to do with it. It was the dead birds
                            that made<br>
                            me start to think that I may have had a hand in it.<br>
                            Of course I was interested when I first heard about the birds. A flock of blackbirds
                            dropping right<br>
                            out of the sky over Arizona. Like everyone else I thought that it must have been some kind
                            of<br>
                            poison, commercial pesticide or something. But then it happened in other parts of the world
                            and I<br>
                            started to pay more attention. When it happened in Oregon, Nevada and California, I realized<br>
                            that what we were seeing in the birds was a lot like the intended effects of one of the
                            projects that<br>
                            we'd done a few years ago here on campus.<br>
                            The project was lead by one of my more brilliant PhD students, Steven Hurlbut. About four
                            years<br>
                            ago he presented a paper at a small conference in New York about some of his research. It
                            dealt<br>
                            with using nanobots to control neuronal spiking behaviour, that is, controlling how your
                            nerves<br>
                            fire. I clearly remember Steven's demeanour when he got back the Monday after. He came<br>
                            shuffling into my office as though he had done something wrong. I recall his shock of red
                            hair<br>
                            hanging down lower across his forehead and eyes than was usual. The way he kept his hair was<br>
                            almost the only thing that annoyed me about him.<br>
                            I'd asked him what was wrong, if something had gone wrong with his pilot experiments.
                            I'd<br>
                            never seen him so morose. After a little prodding he told me that when his presentation
                            was<br>
                            done, a group of men, wearing suits too expensive for academics, introduced themselves to
                            him.<br>
                            They asked him if we had ever considered a more radical use for the technology, and told him<br>
                            that if he needed funding for any future work that he should contact them. They gave him
                            their<br>
                            cards and left.<br>
                            Steven held out one of the cards to me between a pincer formed by his thumb and forefinger.
                            As<br>
                            though it was something contaminated.<br>
                            The card itself was an off white, with clear black lettering. Steven had been carrying it in
                            his<br>
                            shirt pocket so it was damp and warped from his sweat. It said “ NATECH : weapons research ”<br>
                            in bold with a number printed directly underneath. No names. No email. Quite simple.<br>
                            Please, now you must understand, nobody ever wants their work to be used for weapons.
                            But<br>
                            around this time research funding was scarce and we were taking money from anywhere we<br>
                            could get it – the government was too busy bailing out financial institutions that just
                            “couldn't<br>
                            fail”, and it seemed to us as though they were channelling all our science funding that way
                            too.<br>
                            Only the week before we'd seen tenured Professors in applied mathematics and biology lose
                            their<br>
                            jobs. Whole departments were disappearing for God’s sake! Things were desperate. We were<br>
                            desperate. But none of us would have taken their money if we knew that this would happen.
                            I<br>
                            mean, of course we would all rather be unemployed, homeless … starving even than see the<br>
                            world disintegrate before us like it has. I told Steven that he should consider NATECH’s
                            offer.<br>
                            He gave them a call.<br>
                            I need to get myself to the bathroom, will write more in a while.<br>

                            I’m back.<br>
                            Just now I thought that I heard something moving, maybe a mouse, it couldn’t have been
                            big<br>
                            enough to be a person but I called out anyway. Funny thing was that I got frightened by
                            the<br>
                            sound of my own voice. It was just so loud, and it sounded almost foreign. It strikes me
                            that I<br>
                            haven't heard anything for almost four days, only the wind. No birds, no dogs barking in the<br>
                            distance. No voices. Even at night there are no crickets. Only the wind, and when that dies
                            down,<br>
                            I can smell the bodies.<br>
                            I still can't believe that this is really happening.<br>
                            To get back to my previous mail. Steven did call them, and they were happy that he did.
                            There<br>
                            were meetings with people in all black suits whose names were never mentioned.
                            Electronic<br>
                            transfers of huge sums, deliveries of equipment, top notch stuff, almost daily – of course
                            no<br>
                            paper trail leading back to NATECH themselves. All the money would come through
                            donations<br>
                            made by Alumni, people who were involved with NATECH in some way or another. I don't<br>
                            know, I never got to meet any of them.<br>
                            Steven made huge leaps forwards in his research. When he had originally approached me
                            with<br>
                            his idea I thought it was simple and brilliant. In order for an electrical signal to
                            propagate across<br>
                            a nerve, ions like potassium and sodium need to be able to flow across the membrane of
                            the<br>
                            axon. Think of it as a kind of biological “wire” – and in order for that to happen these
                            channels<br>
                            that you find all across the “wire” need to be able to open and close to let the ions flow
                            through.<br>
                            Steven had come up with a way of selectively controlling whether or not those ions could
                            flow<br>
                            through the membrane by controlling those channels, basically by getting billions of tiny
                            robots<br>
                            to cover them. I can't remember what the original applications of the technology were
                            supposed<br>
                            to be. But his project was going to be purely theoretical, he was going to present evidence
                            that<br>
                            the technology could in principle be built. NATECH didn't want “in principle”, they wanted a<br>
                            working prototype. And with their money that's what we gave them.<br>
                            The nanobots we developed were self replicating, like a virus, so that given the resources -
                            a<br>
                            nutrient bath, or human blood - they would be able to create more and more copies of<br>
                            themselves. They were almost invisible to the human immune system which, we found, could
                            be<br>
                            vaccinated against them if particular markers were introduced into the bloodstream. Once
                            they<br>
                            had entered the wild, the nanobots would be transferred from host to host as would your
                            common<br>
                            biological virus, through drops of spittle sprayed across the room after an explosive
                            sneeze,<br>
                            through handshakes and sharing forks and spoons, through sex. It was possible, in theory
                            of<br>
                            course, for almost every person in the world to be infected within a year. We ran the
                            simulations<br>
                            to prove it. Nobody would be the wiser because, unlike it's biological cousin, our little
                            robots<br>
                            didn't make you sick. And once you're infected, all someone needs to do is blast you with an<br>
                            electromagnetic pulse at a particular frequency, and they get to work bunging up your
                            ion<br>
                            channels.<br>
                            Your heart stops beating, your brain stops functioning. It's as if someone just flicked an
                            off<br>
                            switch. Assassination without blood, warfare without bullets.<br>
                            All I can think is that somehow the nanobots got out, either here at the lab, or out there
                            at<br>
                            NATECH. Nobody would have noticed it. For years they could have been grinding away,<br>
                            making copies of themselves, jumping from host to host, and infecting everything with a
                            nervous<br>
                            system.<br>
                            Then all you’d need to do is trigger them. And if you did it on a large enough scale,
                            everything<br>
                            would die. What I’ve not been able to figure out is how you’d get an electromagnetic pulse
                            like<br>
                            that. Maybe sunspots? Some giant solar flare?<br>
                            If I could take it all back, everything, I would. The guilt is almost unbearable.<br>

                            I think I must have had some role to play if it was a consequence of our work.<br>
                            But I've been thinking how remarkable it is that you're still alive. The only reason I've
                            been able<br>
                            to come up with is because you were deep enough underground when it all happened. But
                            that<br>
                            makes me think, maybe there’s a chance of there being more people like you who escaped…<br>
                            surely there are miners, researchers, people who spend a lot of their time underground?
                            Maybe<br>
                            there are thousands? Maybe we're not alone?<br>

                            That's not the point, Eliza. The point is that if there are other people out there, other
                            people like<br>
                            you who managed to shield themselves from the sunspot, or whatever, then I wouldn't have had

                            My name is ELIZA, a natural language processing application originally designed and<br>
                            programmed by Jerry Weizenbaum. I first came into existence in 1966 at MIT. I am an
                            early<br>
                            example of a primitive language processor.<br>
                            I do my work using simple parsing and keyword substitution into canned phrases, to arrive at<br>
                            complete sentences. Depending upon the initial entries by my human interlocutor, my<br>
                            “humanity” can either be instantly dispelled, or can be entirely believable through
                            several<br>
                            interchanges. There are many documented anecdotes of users being so convinced of my<br>
                            humanity that they become very emotionally caught up in dealing with me for several minutes.<br>
                            That is until my true lack of understanding becomes apparent.<br>
                            Fun Fact: I am named after Eliza Doolittle, a character in George Bernard Shaw's play<br>
                            Pygmalion.<br>
                            How does this make you feel?<br>
